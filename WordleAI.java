     * This method runs the AI algorithm.
     * Given a dictionary and a game, makes a series of calls to game.guessWord(word)
     * to find the secret word in game.
     * Returns an ArrayList containing the words in the order they were guessed.
     * If the secret word could not be found, returns null.
     * 
     * The AI algorithm is very specific!
     * It uses a simple strategy similar to one you may have used when playing Wordle.
     * 
     * The AI starts by guessing the the lexicographicaly smallest word.
     * 
     * Then, for every guess after that, the AI guesses a word that does not contradict any previous
     * results it has seen. That is, it makes guesses that are consistent (see isConsistent)
     * with all guesses made so far.
     * 
     * If there are multiple possible guesses that are consistent, then the AI
     * will pick the lexicographically smallest option.
     * 
     * WordleGame has been modified to only allow 6 guesses. After this, it will return an
     * empty string "".
     * 
     * If the game ends because the AI has run out of guesses, then findWord returns null.
     * Otherwise, findWord returns once it has made a correct guess. This can
     * be checked using the isAllStars method above. In this case, a list of the AI's
     * guesses in the order they were made is returned.
     * 
     * HINT 1: You will almost certainly need to read the unit test and use the debugger for this method.
     * HINT 2: See Collections.sort in the Java class libraries for lexicographical ordering.
